# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

This project is an implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using Python and Streamlit. CAPM is a widely-used financial model for calculating the expected return on an investment based on its risk and the market's overall risk.

The project utilizes the Streamlit library for building an interactive web application to visualize stock prices, calculate beta values, and estimate expected returns using CAPM.

## Features

- Choose the number of years of historical data for analysis.
- Display the stock prices and market index (S&P 500) over time.
- Calculate and display the beta values for each selected stock.
- Estimate the expected returns for the selected stocks using CAPM.
